# Description  
Microcontroller-based color detection can be difficult. Color sensors are expensive and most of the sensor kits do not come with color sensors. It is an issue I face time and time again in my classes when a student wants to do color-detection using an Arduino for sorting or some other application. Most suggestions you find online tell you to use a camera, which can be expensive and is overkill computationally, or to use an IR sensor, which cannot really distinguish colors and varies wildly.  

After the dozenth time of running into this issue, I realized that we may be able to exploit a fundamental property of semiconductors to create a DIY, low-cost color sensor using components you likely already have. In this tutorial, I will give you a quick crash course in semiconductors and LEDs to learn how we can build a color sensor out of an RGB LED that is sufficient for many applications.
