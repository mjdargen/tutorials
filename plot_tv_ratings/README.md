Have you ever visited https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/ and wondered how they created such beautiful graphs? Well, now you can create some of your own! This tutorial will teach you how to create similarly beautiful graphs and with this project we will create interactive graphs that show the ratings of all episodes in a TV show.  

We will learn how to use cinemagoer package to retrieve information from IMDb, basic file I/O, how to process a CSV file using Pandas, and how to create interactive plots with Plotly. This knowledge is easily transferrable to any other data science project.  

To run this code in your environment, you will need to:  
   * Install Python 3 and pip
   * Install cinemagoer (imdbpy), pandas, plotly: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
